Project Progress:
1. (date undefined) 
    Idea: Analysis uncertainty of road speed and uncertainty of pois distribution 
    Implement:Road Network View, 
    speed of each road segnment is assigned as color of the road, 
    uncertainty of each road segnment is assigned as width of the road.
    Datasource: json,
    https://web.cs.kent.edu/~ywu23/uncertinty/uncertainty.html
    
2. (date undefined)
    Idea: Follow the idea of uncertainty of weather, draw contour on map to represent the reachbility.
    Implement: Contour View including multiple selection(time)
    Datasource: json,
    https://web.cs.kent.edu/~ywu23/uncertinty/contour_multiselection.html
    
3. (04/21/2016)
    Idea: For each poi, compute a 7*24 matrix(x axis is 24 hours, y axis is 7 weekdays) to represent the reachbility from center point.
    Draw Heatmap for each poi (on click)
    center point latlng: 30.24659290255, 120.17695426940918 hangzhou railway station.
    Datasource: postgresql database
    Database: poi
    New Tables: poi_road(contains pois within 5 km from center point, for each poi, contains all the related road segnments(within 200 meters))
                traveltime(contains travel time to all the roads from center point, contains information for each weekday and each hour)
                
4. (04/28/2016)
    Idea: Combine progress 1 and progress 3, try to update the backend system. Update color range
          Draw poi information as popup 
          Create cluster view while zoom out
          change poi related street segnments distance to 100 and remove those empty records
